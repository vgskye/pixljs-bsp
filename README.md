# Board Support Package for the {manufacturer} {board}

This crate is a Board Support Package (BSP). It wraps the HAL crate ({hal
crate name}) for the on-board {CPU}, and provides high level wrappers for the
onboard features:

* 29 on-board LEDs
* Bosch XX123 IÂ²C Temperature Sensor
* 5 on-board buttons
* Add your actual on-board components here

This BSP assumes you are not using a bootloader / using the XXXX bootloader /
running in non-secure mode (delete as applicable).

## Usage

You will require the `thumbv7em-none-eabihf` target installed. To build one of these examples:

```console
$ rustup target add thumbv7em-none-eabihf
$ git clone https://github.com/nrf-rs/nrf-bsp-template.git
$ cd nrf-bsp-template
$ cargo build --target=thumbv7em-none-eabihf --example blinky
```

To use in your own application, add as a dependency and call the
`Board::init()` function.
